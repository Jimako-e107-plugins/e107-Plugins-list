### Userjournals plugin

This plugin allows the e107 CMS to support individual journals for
registered/logged-in users. Each user gets their own journal, and
can write, edit, and delete their entries. Admin has the option of
totally disabling User Journals, as well as restricting access to
logged-in users only.

Note: This plugin is used for replacing of Journal Nuke module, so it is used. But it was only fixed, not fully updated for new e107 standards. 

###  MastHead plugin

This plugin is attempt how to replace missing functionality with Welcome message. The idea was used in core Hero plugin. Pro alternative is JM Elements plugin.

Some free theme still uses this, so if any problems, use forum or this repo for reporting issues.
